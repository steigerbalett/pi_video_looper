# pi_video_looper
Application to turn your Raspberry Pi into a dedicated looping video playback device.

Just plugin your USB-Drive to the RaspberryPi and it will scan it for movies. After a few seconds it will start to play the movies found in the root and +1 subdirectory in an endless loop. You can stop the videlooper by hitting the <ESC> - Key.
